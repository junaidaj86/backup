### Eulerian Cycle
degree of very vertex should be even.

### Eulerian Path
If there exists an Eulerian path in a connected graph, either that path is a cycle, or it starts and ends at two different vertices. These are the only two vertices that would have an odd degree.

### Graph representation

1. [[Edge list]]
2. [[Adjacency list]]
3. [[Adjacency matrix]]

Different Algorithm

1. [[BFS]]
2. [[DFS]]
3. [[Topological sort]]
4. [[Detect cycle in graph]]
5. [[Bipartite]]
