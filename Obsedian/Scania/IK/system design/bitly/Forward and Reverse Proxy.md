### Forward Proxy:

A forward proxy, also known as a proxy server or just "proxy," acts as an intermediary between client devices (such as web browsers) and the internet. When a client requests a resource from the internet, the request first goes through the forward proxy server. The forward proxy then forwards the request to the target server, retrieves the requested resource, and sends it back to the client.

1. Forward proxies are often used to enhance security and privacy, as they can mask the original IP address of the client, providing anonymity. 
2. They are also employed to cache frequently requested resources, reducing bandwidth usage and speeding up access to commonly accessed content.
3. Filter content which the organisation can access

**Reverse Proxy:**

A reverse proxy, on the other hand, handles requests on behalf of server instances. Instead of forwarding client requests to the internet, a reverse proxy takes incoming requests and directs them to the appropriate backend server. The client interacts directly with the reverse proxy, which then forwards the request to the backend server, retrieves the response, and sends it back to the client.

1. Reverse proxies are beneficial for load balancing, distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and prevent overloading a single server. 
2. They also provide an additional layer of security by concealing the internal structure of a network.
3. Handle tasks like SSL termination.
4. Caching 
5. Compression to improve overall system efficiency.
