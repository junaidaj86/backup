latency = Awaiting service, not being actually served.
response time = latency + processing time.

Latency:
1. Transmission delay
2. propagation delay
3. Queuing Delay

But most important in Transmission Delay. Transmission delay is nothing but bandwidth

Bandwidth required = size of message / bandwidth

Imagine we have to download a photo from some server

Transmission time = 25 MB (size of photo)/ 10mbps = 25 * 10^6 * 8 / 10 * 10^6 = 20 sec

if we increase the bandwidth then the transmission time will be less.

If we had 100 MBPS then the time will be 0.2 sec.
