## SLI
We use service level indicator(SLI) to measure performance for the complete service
Below are the metrics with which we should compare SLI
1. Correctness : Almost all request should be correct
2. Availability: Defined by number of 9s. 99.999 means for 1000 request 1 was not responded.
3. Throughput
4. Response time

## SLO (Service level Objective)

example of SLO is response time should be less than 50 ms and availibility should be 99.999

### SLA (Service level Agreement)

If we miss SLO then, we have to pay some penalty.
